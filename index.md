## Welcome to my Neural Net Blog

The purpose of this blog is to track my progress and centralize resources as I learn about neural networks.

My main resource for learning will be the [Convolution Deep Learning For Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) taught by [Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/). All of the [2016 course content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) is available free online.

Also, becuase I learn best by doing, my plan is to build a neural network in Javascript using the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) collection of 60,000 handwitten integers between 0 and 9 to train and test the network.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GitFrog/GitFrog.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
