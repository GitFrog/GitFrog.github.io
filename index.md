## Welcome to my Neural Net Blog

My name is Lee Hulse-Smith, and I'm a Full Stack Software Developer at the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto, Canada. 

I first became interested in neural networks after following the autonomous driving work being done by Tesla, Waymo, and Uber.

The purpose of this blog is to track my progress and centralize resources as I learn about neural networks.

My main resource for learning will be the [Convolution Deep Learning For Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) taught by [Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/). All of the [2016 course content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) is available free online.

Also, becuase I learn best by doing, my plan is to build a neural network in Javascript using the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) collection of 60,000 handwitten integers between 0 and 9 to train and test the network.
