## Welcome to my Neural Net Blog

My name is Lee Hulse-Smith, and I'm a Full Stack Software Developer at the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto, Canada. 

I first became interested in neural networks after following the autonomous driving work being done by Tesla, Waymo, and Uber.

The purpose of this blog is to track my progress and centralize resources as I learn about neural networks.

My main resource for learning will be the [Convolution Deep Learning For Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) taught by [Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/). All of the [2016 course content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) is available free online.

Also, becuase I learn best by doing, my plan is to build a neural network in Javascript using the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) collection of 60,000 handwitten integers between 0 and 9 to train and test the network.

## Introduction

What is a neural network, and when would you want to use one? Let's start with the following [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic.

Here we have two problems that our programmer is being asked to solve. The first one is relatively easy, since most photos contain geological information embedded in the image. The second one is bordering on insane. How would you go about writing a program that could "read" an image and not only tell that it contains a bird, but go one step further and identify the
